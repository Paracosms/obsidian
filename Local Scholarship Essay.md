- Describe the world I come from
    - I come from a Christian Filipino family who are first generation immigrants to the US from the Philippines
    - Growing up in the era of a maturing world wide web, I was practically raised by the internet
    - I learned through technology and how to use its power from a young age (taking Khan Academy programming courses in 3rd grade)
- How has my world shaped my dreams and aspirations?
    - From being constantly immersed in technology, I took a deep interest in the software development process, particularly intrigued by how video games were made
    - My dream job is to be a video game programmer, but I also love contributing to mainstream problems and solving them through software development
- What evidence do I have to prove my passion, and what are some goals I have?
    - After participating in a 48 hour game jam, I realized how much passion I had for game development and coding up a piece of software
    - I want to graduate college with a computer science/software engineering degree, and obtain a job in either game development or software engineering
- Why is college important to me?
    - College is where I can finally take my learning of computer science and software engineering to the next level
    - I would meet a lot of new people who could potentially give me different ways to view the world and discover more about myself
- Conclusion
    - Most importantly, college would give me the resources and knowledge I need to be able to give back to the internet that raised me; I want to develop and contribute to software that makes the world a better place.

THESIS:
Born into the generation with a heavy reliance on the internet .

Coming from a Christian Filipino family, I looked up to my parents who were able to thrive in the US as first generation immigrants. My dad, working a job as a data analyst, bestowed on me my very first computer: an old Dell laptop.
