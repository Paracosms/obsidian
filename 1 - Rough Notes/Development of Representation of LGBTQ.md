Slide 1: Title
- Intro LGTBQ as a marginalized group that has always existed but never found representation until recent history
- Ask how many people grew up hearing negative things about LGBTQ relationships

Slide 2: 
- “Originally, both terms {homosexuality/heterosexuality} were used primarily by physicians. Eventually, heterosexuality lost its medical connotations and came to be used as a term for so-called ‘normal sex’ between a man and a woman (Katz 1995, 83-112). Homosexuality, however, continued to be officially regarded as a medical abnormality and/or a psychological disorder. By the mid-1930s, homosexuality and individuals who were involved in same sex relationships were largely reviled in the United States.” (Holtzman 417-418)
- In this way, homosexuality became a derogatory term and heterosexuality was perceived as good and 'normal'

I think when film came around the world started being more accepting of everyone for who they are. In my opinion it's because people were able to see and relate to characters in film as human beings. They stopped 'hatecriming' people because they felt empathy, their experiences and stories were now broadcast all over TV.

Think about it like this. You grew up thinking that being straight was "correct" and "normal," or maybe that all gay people are evil. Maybe you and your friends threw out gay jokes on an hourly basis. Then one day you watch one movie that really hits home, and there are some characters who identify as LGBTQ. The next time your friend makes a gay joke, there's now a clear image of a person in your mind who you know would feel hurt. I think that effect that film has on people is what catapulted LGBTQ representation in recent years.
