“Originally, both terms {homosexuality/heterosexuality} were used primarily by physicians. Eventually, heterosexuality lost its medical connotations and came to be used as a term for so-called ‘normal sex’ between a man and a woman (Katz 1995, 83-112). Homosexuality, however, continued to be officially regarded as a medical abnormality and/or a psychological disorder. By the mid-1930s, homosexuality and individuals who were involved in same sex relationships were largely reviled in the United States.”

analysis

“In 1991 social critic Michael Warner coined the term heteronormativity to describe the devaluing and marginalizing of LGBT people based on prevailing institutional practices and cultural beliefs that represent males as ‘opposite from and superior to females and heterosexuals as opposite from and superior to people who are lesbian or gay”

The coinage and usage of the term heteronormativity reinforces and implies the belief that heterosexuality is good and normal, and that anything outside of that is bad and wrong.
