“Originally, both terms {homosexuality/heterosexuality} were used primarily by physicians. Eventually, heterosexuality lost its medical connotations and came to be used as a term for so-called ‘normal sex’ between a man and a woman (Katz 1995, 83-112). Homosexuality, however, continued to be officially regarded as a medical abnormality and/or a psychological disorder. By the mid-1930s, homosexuality and individuals who were involved in same sex relationships were largely reviled in the United States.”
