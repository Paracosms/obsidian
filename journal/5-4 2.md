This entry is dedicated to the second half of my 2 weeks of freedom. I think the experiences in these entries are the most fun I've had this year so far. 

4/25
After our wifi randomly went out, I decided to check out our router settings and found out one of the ethernet cords was giving 10x faster download and upload speeds than mine. It turned out to be connected to my brother's PC. I swapped his cord out with mine. After that, Lola asked me to help her clean out the backyard, so I pulled out all of the weeds that have been growing since the last time I pulled them out last year. It looks a lot cleaner now.
