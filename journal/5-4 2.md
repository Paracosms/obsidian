This entry is dedicated to the second half of my 2 weeks of freedom. I think the experiences in these entries are the most fun I've had this year so far.

After our wifi randomly went out, I decided to check out our router settings and found out one of the ethernet cords was giving 10x faster download and upload speeds than mine. It turned out to be connected to my brother's PC. I swapped his cord out with mine. After that, Lola asked me to help her clean out the backyard, so I pulled out all of the weeds that have been growing since the last time I pulled them out last year. It looks a lot cleaner now.

Today started off with medicine, food, and gambling. I had to run a lot of chores with my Lola in the morning, so we went to Walgreens to pick up her medicine. Surprisingly, there was no line, so we went to In-N-Out to pick up my food, and Jollibee for hers. Then, for some reason, she decided she wanted to buy scratch offs, so we went to the gas station right by our house.

We were supposed to see Nathaniel's play at 3pm today, but Wisdom texted me around noon that he couldn't go; he had to bring his dad home from the airport apparently. Luckily, there was a 7pm showing, so we decided we'd just go then. Yesterday, I texted Yzi randomly asking if she would do the ice bucket challenge if I nominated her. Since I wasn't doing anything until 7pm, I asked her if I should come over. She said sure. So, without my parents knowing, I drove 30 minutes all the way to Mountain House. I really enjoyed driving and listening to old playlists. When I got there though, she texted me she got grounded for going out so much. She said she'd try to figure it out so I took a small walk around the town.
