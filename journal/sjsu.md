hi ! I'm Andrew and I'm from the East Bay Area. I am fully committed to SJSU as a Software Engineering major. I love hanging out with my friends, taking pictures, and capturing memories of them. I listen to a lot of indie music like Good Kid and Origami Angel, and enjoy making covers of songs with my friends. In my free time I play piano and video games, create videos, work out, or even game dev occasionally for fun.

I'm also looking for roommates or new friends to meet, so I'm always down to talk !
