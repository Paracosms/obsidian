AP exams are finally over. I never have to take a national standardized test ever again. I don't even wanna know how much money I've forked over to Collegeboard throughout all of high school. On the bright side, it's all finally over. No more high school work for the rest of my life.

I guess I'll talk about the AP tests first. Statistics was my first test, and there was a surprising amount of people taking the exam. I knew a good portion of everyone there, so it was fun seeing and talking to people during the breaks. The test itself wasn't too hard, I was relearning some of the information on the test as it went on. The FRQ was also pretty good. They kept hyping up the elusive "investigative task" in our review sessions so I was a little bit anxious as to how hard it would be. It ended up being a wall of text that simply asked you to apply a formula and extrapolate its meaning in a real world context. Predicting a 5. After the test, I took Wisdom and Julia to McDonalds. Since the gate was locked and I was the only one with a town pass out, I had to cram Julia and Wisdom into the trunk of Julia's car while driving there. I drove out of the parking lot using Julia's car, and after flashing my town pass to the guard, I successfully smuggled them out. Julia and Wisdom had a government test that same day, so they had to go back to school. I decided to just go home, but when I got to the parking lot, the gate was closed and there was no guard to let us through. I ran into Vanessa there and we kinda just waited until someone came to let us through.

Environmental Science was not that bad. I sat next to EJ in the very far right corner of the upper gym, and while everyone was getting set up, I was playing Minecraft. I made it my goal to try and find diamonds before we had to get started. I ended up branch mining for 20 minutes before finding my first couple diamonds. The test wasn't very difficult at all, I did forget a few details on my FRQ, but I think it went okay. I'm expecting a 5 but wouldn't be surprised if I got a 4.

I then waited a week, because Physics 1 was my final AP on the final day of AP testing. I was pretty stressed out the night before. I didn't get the sleep schedule I wanted and ended up staying up a little later than I would've liked. I was pretty nervous on test day. Since there were only 2 periods taking the test, each person got a whole table to themselves. Starting the test, I thought the first few questions weren't that bad. I was aiming for a 3, so it was okay to guess on a few. I ended up finishing with enough time to check some difficult questions. After a short break, we moved onto the FRQ section. I genuinely think I did really good on this section. I completed every part with answers I was decently satisfied with. After the test, I called Nathaniel and talked to him about the test while we both drove home. We also played Balatro for the first time in a while.

Prom was more fun than I was expecting. My parents drove me out to San Jose and dropped me off at the hotel we were staying at. I'm really thankful we were able to stay the night because we barely had a functioning plan until the week before. Anyways, I changed into my suit in the bathroom, and we walked around the area waiting for prom to start. We went to the outskirts of SJSU and found a burger place that was extremely cheap, and I even got a burger for free.
